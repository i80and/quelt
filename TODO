Things I intend to do in the future (don't hold your breath):
* Refactor the internals.  They could be worse, but they could also be much
  better.
* quelt: Finish cross-chunk template stripping, and remove XML comments.

Things I will probably only do if specifically asked:
* Make a more sophisticated WikiMarkup parser, finally making use of the
  currently-unused pprint module.
