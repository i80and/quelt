Things I intend to do in the future (don't hold your breath):
* quelt-split: Sort the database so we can binary-search.  Heapsort has good characteristics for the purpose.
* quelt: Finish cross-chunk template stripping, and remove XML comments.

Things I will probably only do if specifically asked:
* Fix database endianness issues.  I don't have a big-endian machine (even my MIPS box is mipsel), so this would be an abstract exercise.
* Make a more sophisticated WikiMarkup parser, finally making use of the currently-unused pprint module.
